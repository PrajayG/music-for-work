## What do you listen to while coding?

Mostly instrumental post-rock. Bands like Explosions in the Sky or Mogwai. I find lyrics distracting when I'm trying to hold complex logic in my head.

## Do you have a favorite album?

"The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place" by Explosions in the Sky. It's perfect for a 4-hour coding block.

## How does music affect your productivity?

It's a trigger for flow state. As soon as I put my headphones on and start that playlist, my brain knows it's time to focus.
